**Original Bug:**
The function assumed all values are unique and initialized 'largest' and 'second' to a fixed low value (-9999999), which may not work for all input ranges.

**Problem:**
- If all numbers are negative and lower than -9999999, the function gives wrong results.
- Duplicates are not handled properly (e.g., [10, 10, 10] returns 10 instead of an error or notice).
- It doesn't check whether the list has at least 2 unique values.

**Fix:**
- Used `set()` to eliminate duplicates.
- Checked if there are at least two unique numbers.
- Sorted the unique list and returned the second element.
