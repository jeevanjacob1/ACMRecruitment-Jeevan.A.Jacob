# Sorting Algorithm Choice

I have chosen to implement the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by comparing each new element to those already sorted and inserting it at the correct position.

The test array used is: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6].

The algorithm successfully sorts the array in ascending order.
