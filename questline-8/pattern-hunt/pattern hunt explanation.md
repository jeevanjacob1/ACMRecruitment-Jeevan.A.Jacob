(Sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, ...)

differences between terms:
6 - 2 = 4
12 - 6 = 6
20 - 12 = 8
The differences are increasing by 2 each time .so the sequence is generated by adding consecutive even numbers starting from 4.
so we can get the formula:  Xn=n(n+1).
so, The next two terms are 30 and 42.

so the completed sequence: 2,6,12,20,30,42,...
